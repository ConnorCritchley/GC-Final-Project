    "This project aims to compare safety ratings from crash tests to actual data of fatal crashes. The use of fatal crash data is better suited for hard crashes where occupant life is and was in danger, providing more relevant data entries compared to fender benders or other minimal 'traffic incidents'. This analysis could be useful for car buyers, car manufactureres, government testers, and insurance companies."
